# Flicklet Workspace Rules

## Core Principles
- Always reference Cursor Rules/cursor rules.md before starting tasks
- Follow Mobile Compact V1 rules for React V2 work (apps/web only)
- Use task template format with proper scope banner
- Never modify www/ unless explicitly scoped as Legacy V1 work
- Feature flags default OFF, use localStorage format flag:<name>
- Tests must detect console errors, reports go in reports/
- Rollback must be one flag flip or single revert commit
