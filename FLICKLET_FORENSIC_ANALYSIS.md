# Flicklet App - Complete Forensic Analysis

## Overview

Flicklet is a sophisticated TV and movie tracking web application built with vanilla JavaScript, Firebase, and TMDB API. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA) with mobile-first design, featuring user authentication, cloud sync, and comprehensive media management.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDB) API
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for native app packaging
- **Styling**: CSS Custom Properties, Mobile-first responsive design

### Data Storage System
The app uses a dual storage approach:

**Local Storage**: Primary data persistence in `localStorage` as `flicklet-data`:
```javascript
{
  tv: { watching: [], wishlist: [], watched: [] },
  movies: { watching: [], wishlist: [], watched: [] },
  settings: { 
    pro: false, 
    episodeTracking: false, 
    theme: 'light', 
    lang: 'en', 
    username: '', 
    displayName: '' 
  }
}
```

**Cloud Sync**: When signed in, everything automatically syncs to Firebase Firestore under `users/{uid}/` with the same structure.

## Authentication System

### Sign-In Methods
The app offers three authentication options:

1. **Google Sign-In**: Uses popup on desktop, automatically falls back to redirect on mobile/blocked popups
2. **Apple Sign-In**: Always uses redirect (never popup) - shows warning on localhost since Apple requires verified domains
3. **Email/Password**: Shows a modal form for direct email/password entry

### Username Flow
After successful sign-in:
1. System checks if user has a username set
2. If not, shows modal asking **"what should we call you?"**
3. User input gets saved to both:
   - `appData.settings.username` (for sarcastic header message)
   - `appData.settings.displayName` (for account button)
4. Username appears in left-justified header area (`#leftSnark`) with sarcastic remark like "welcome back, legend âœ¨"
5. If username is changed later in settings, system warns user and updates both header and Firebase

## Main App Sections

### Home Tab - Dashboard
The home page contains 5 main groups:

1. **Your Shows Section**:
   - **Currently Watching Rail**: Shows from both TV and movies you're actively watching
   - **Up Next Rail**: Next episodes for TV shows you're watching

2. **Community Section**:
   - **Left Half**: YouTube player with curated content
   - **Right Half**: Games (FlickWord top, Trivia bottom)

3. **For You Section**: 3 customizable genre rails with smart defaults

4. **In Theaters Section**: Current movies with theater information

5. **Feedback Section**: Form for user feedback

### Other Tabs
- **Currently Watching**: All actively watched content with count badges
- **Want to Watch**: Wishlist with count badges  
- **Already Watched**: Completed shows/movies with count badges
- **Discover**: Personalized recommendations based on ratings and viewing habits
- **Settings**: Six sub-sections (General, Notifications, Layout, Data, Pro, About)

## Smart "For You" System

### Intelligent Genre Detection
The system analyzes your watching history to provide personalized recommendations:

1. **Smart Analysis**: Counts genre occurrences in `appData.tv.watching` and `appData.movies.watching`
2. **Top 3 Selection**: Picks the most common genres from your actual viewing habits
3. **Automatic Defaults**: Creates rails for your most-watched genres

### User Customization
In Settings â†’ Layout, users can override smart defaults with 3 dropdown sets per rail:
- **Main Genre**: Drama, Comedy, Action, etc.
- **Sub-Genre**: Crime, Romance, Thriller, etc.
- **Media Type**: Movies, TV, Both

### Fallback System
If no customization and insufficient watching data, defaults to:
- "Drama & Crime"
- "Comedy & Romance" 
- "Sci-Fi & Fantasy"

## Rating System

### User Rating Storage
User ratings are stored per movie/show in the main data structure:
```javascript
{
  id: 123,
  title: "Breaking Bad",
  userRating: 5,  // User's 1-5 star rating
  rating: 9.5,   // TMDB's average rating
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Rating Interface
- Cards display 5 open stars for 1-5 star ratings
- Ratings stored as `userRating` field
- Used for discovery algorithm and personal tracking
- Higher-rated items appear in Discover recommendations

### Rating Functions
- `updateUserRating(itemId, rating)` - Updates local and cloud storage
- `saveUserRating(id, rating)` - Saves rating to Firebase

## Holiday Chip System

### Implementation
- Every card has a "Holiday +" chip in top-right corner
- Click opens modal with holiday category options (Christmas, Halloween, etc.)
- Selected holiday updates card with "Holiday: [Category]" badge
- Holiday assignments stored in card's data structure

### Future Integration
When Holiday Selections tab is implemented:
- Cards with holiday tags automatically appear in Holiday tab
- Content categorized by seasonal themes
- Enables seasonal content discovery

## Community Features

### YouTube Player Integration
**Current Implementation**:
- Pulls from `/data/community-seed.json` with manually curated content
- Contains horror trailers, movie spotlights, etc.
- Uses YouTube embed API with autoplay, controls, playlist management
- Daily rotation (same video all day, changes at midnight)

**Content Structure**:
```javascript
{
  "id": "horror-001",
  "type": "TRAILER_SPOTLIGHT", 
  "title": "The Exorcist (1973)",
  "media": {
    "kind": "youtube",
    "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDGw1MTEe9k",
    "autoplay": false,
    "controls": true
  },
  "attribution": {
    "displayName": "Flicklet Picks",
    "watermark": "Top Horror"
