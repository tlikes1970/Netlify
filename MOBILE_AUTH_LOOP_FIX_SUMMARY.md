# Mobile Sign-On Loop Fixes - Summary

## Version
**0.1.74** - Mobile auth loop fixes

---

## Problem
Mobile devices experienced infinite sign-on loops when attempting to authenticate via OAuth redirects. The loops were caused by:
1. SessionStorage cleanup breaking Firebase auth state
2. Too-short retry delays on slow mobile networks
3. No throttling of rapid auth attempts
4. Unnecessary retry attempts when URL had no auth params

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed SessionStorage Cleanup ‚ùå
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

**Problem:**
- Code was manually removing `sessionStorage` items with key `pendingRedirect`
- This broke Firebase's internal auth state tracking
- Firebase stores auth state in sessionStorage
- Manual removal caused auth to fail, triggering retry ‚Üí loop

**Fix:**
```typescript
// REMOVED THIS ENTIRE SECTION:
for (let i = 0; i < sessionStorage.length; i++) {
  const key = sessionStorage.key(i);
  if (key && key.includes('pendingRedirect')) {
    sessionStorage.removeItem(key); // ‚ùå This broke Firebase auth
  }
}

// REPLACED WITH:
// ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Never modify Firebase's sessionStorage
// Firebase manages its own auth state. Manual removal causes auth loops.
// We only log, never modify sessionStorage keys that Firebase uses.
```

**Impact:** SessionStorage is now read-only for debugging, never modified. Firebase manages its own state.

### 2. Mobile Network Retry Delay ‚è±Ô∏è
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

**Problem:**
- Fixed 500ms retry delay was too short for slow mobile networks
- Retry happened before redirect completed on cellular connections
- Caused overlapping auth attempts

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Detect if mobile for longer retry delay
const ua = navigator.userAgent || '';
const isMobile = /iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(ua);
const retryDelay = isMobile ? 1500 : 500; // 3x longer on mobile

// Also: Only retry if URL has auth params
if (hasAuthParams) {
  // ... retry logic
} else {
  logger.debug('No auth params in URL - skipping retry');
}
```

**Impact:** Mobile devices now wait 1.5 seconds before retry vs 500ms, preventing premature retries on slow networks.

---

### 3. Auth Attempt Throttling üõ°Ô∏è
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

**Problem:**
- No rate limiting on auth attempts
- Failed redirects could trigger immediate retry
- User clicking multiple times could cause loops

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Track recent auth attempts to prevent loops
const AUTH_ATTEMPT_KEY = 'flicklet.auth.attempt.timestamp';
const AUTH_ATTEMPT_WINDOW = 30000; // 30 seconds

function shouldBlockAuthAttempt(): boolean {
  const lastAttempt = localStorage.getItem(AUTH_ATTEMPT_KEY);
  if (!lastAttempt) return false;
  
  const timeSince = Date.now() - parseInt(lastAttempt);
  return timeSince < AUTH_ATTEMPT_WINDOW;
}

function recordAuthAttempt(): void {
  localStorage.setItem(AUTH_ATTEMPT_KEY, Date.now().toString());
}

// Applied to both signInWithGoogle() and signInWithApple()
if (shouldBlockAuthAttempt()) {
  throw new Error('Authentication attempted too frequently. Please wait a moment and try again.');
}
recordAuthAttempt();
```

**Impact:** Auth attempts are now throttled to max once per 30 seconds, preventing rapid retry loops.

---

### 4. Smarter Retry Logic üß†
**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`

**Problem:**
- Always retried even when URL had no auth params
- Wasted retry attempts on normal page loads
- Retry triggered when user wasn't actually signing in

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Only retry if we have auth params in URL (actually returning from redirect)
if (hasAuthParams) {
  // ... retry with mobile-aware delay
} else {
  logger.debug('No auth params in URL and no redirect result - user is not signing in via redirect');
}
```

**Impact:** Retry logic only triggers when URL actually contains auth parameters, avoiding unnecessary retries.

## Files Modified

1. `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` - Core auth manager with loop fixes
2. `apps/web/src/version.ts` - Version bump to 0.1.74

---

## Testing Required

### Critical Test Cases:
1. **Slow 3G Network**
   - Set Chrome DevTools to "Slow 3G"
   - Attempt Google sign-in on mobile device
   - Verify no loops occur
   - Expected: Single redirect, success on return

2. **Rapid Clicking**
   - Tap sign-in button multiple times rapidly
   - Expected: Error message after first attempt, no loop

3. **Service Worker Cache**
   - Enable service worker
   - Sign in, go offline, sign in again
   - Expected: Graceful handling, no loops

4. **Return Without Auth**
   - Close browser during Google sign-in
   - Reopen app
   - Expected: No auth loop, clean state

### Mobile Device Testing:
- ‚úÖ Safari on iPhone (iOS 15+)
- ‚úÖ Chrome on Android (Android 10+)
- ‚úÖ Samsung Internet
- ‚úÖ Firefox Mobile

### Network Conditions:
- ‚úÖ Fast 4G/LTE
- ‚úÖ Slow 3G (simulate)
- ‚úÖ Edge network
- ‚úÖ Wi-Fi

---

## Expected Behavior

**Before Fix:**
```
User taps sign-in ‚Üí App redirects to Google ‚Üí User signs in ‚Üí Returns to app ‚Üí 
SessionStorage cleared ‚Üí Auth state broken ‚Üí Retry fires ‚Üí New redirect ‚Üí Loop üîÅ
```

**After Fix:**
```
User taps sign-in ‚Üí App redirects to Google ‚Üí User signs in ‚Üí Returns to app ‚Üí 
Auth state intact ‚Üí Success detected ‚Üí User signed in ‚úÖ
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
```bash
# Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD
# Or manually restore auth.ts to remove the fixes
```

Version 0.1.73 had mobile auth loops, version 0.1.74 fixes them.

## Technical Details

### Why SessionStorage Cleanup Broke Auth:
Firebase uses sessionStorage to track:
- OAuth redirect state
- Pending auth operations
- Redirect URLs and parameters
- Auth state across page reloads

When we removed `sessionStorage` items:
1. Firebase loses track of pending redirect
2. `getRedirectResult()` returns null
3. Code retries auth attempt
4. New redirect starts
5. Loop continues

### Why Mobile Had Issues:
- Mobile networks have higher latency (200-1000ms)
- React renders slower on mobile processors
- Service workers add another layer of complexity
- Cookies/sessionStorage behave differently on mobile browsers

500ms retry wasn't enough for mobile ‚Üí premature retry ‚Üí loop

### Why 30 Second Throttle:
- Gives Firebase time to complete auth operation
- Prevents accidental rapid clicking
- Allows user to recover from temporary failures
- Balances security with UX

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing** - Test on real mobile device with slow network
2. **Monitor Production** - Watch for auth loop errors after deployment
3. **Consider Alternative** - If loops continue, consider:
   - Using popup flow on mobile instead of redirect
   - Adding UI indicator during auth ("Signing in...")
   - Implementing exponential backoff for retries
4. **User Feedback** - Monitor for user reports of sign-in issues
