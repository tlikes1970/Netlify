# Accessibility Gap Analysis - Phase A

## Axe CLI Results
- **Status**: ✅ 0 violations found
- **Coverage**: 20-50% of accessibility issues can be automatically detected
- **Manual Testing Required**: Yes

## Current Accessibility Status
The application shows no critical accessibility violations in the automated scan, which is excellent. However, manual testing is still required to ensure comprehensive accessibility compliance.

## Areas Requiring Manual Review

### 1. Focus Management
- **Check**: Logical tab order throughout the application
- **Check**: Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- **Check**: No keyboard traps in modals or complex components

### 2. Screen Reader Support
- **Check**: All form inputs have proper labels
- **Check**: ARIA roles and properties are correctly implemented
- **Check**: Dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers

### 3. Color and Contrast
- **Check**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1)
- **Check**: Color is not the only means of conveying information
- **Check**: Interactive elements have sufficient contrast in all states

### 4. Navigation and Structure
- **Check**: Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- **Check**: Landmark regions are properly defined
- **Check**: Skip links are available and functional

### 5. Interactive Elements
- **Check**: All buttons and links have accessible names
- **Check**: Form validation messages are properly associated
- **Check**: Custom components follow accessibility patterns

## Next Steps for Phase B
1. **Lighthouse Testing**: Run Lighthouse accessibility audits on desktop and mobile
2. **Manual Testing**: Conduct keyboard-only navigation testing
3. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with actual screen reader software
4. **Color Contrast Audit**: Verify all color combinations meet WCAG standards
5. **Focus Management Review**: Ensure proper focus handling in dynamic content

## Success Criteria
- **Lighthouse Accessibility**: ≥95 (Desktop & Mobile)
- **Axe Violations**: 0 serious/critical issues
- **Manual Testing**: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader**: All content properly announced
