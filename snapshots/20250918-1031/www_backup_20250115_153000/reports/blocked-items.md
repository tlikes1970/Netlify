# Blocked Items Analysis

## Upstream Dependencies

### 1. Sticky Search System
**Impact**: HIGH - Cannot modify `.top-search` or ancestor overflow/transform/contain
**Affected Features**: 
- FAB positioning may conflict with sticky search
- Quote marquee positioning needs to avoid search area
- Modal overlays must not interfere with search functionality

**Mitigation**: 
- Ensure all new features respect existing sticky search boundaries
- Use `position: relative` instead of `position: fixed` where possible
- Test all new overlays with search functionality

### 2. Global Layout System
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Cannot modify global layout or sticky behavior
**Affected Features**:
- FAB docking system must work within existing layout
- Quote marquee must not cause layout shifts
- Pro previews must not break existing responsive design

**Mitigation**:
- All changes must be additive, not modifying existing layout
- Use existing CSS variables and design tokens
- Test on all screen sizes and orientations

### 3. Data Store Architecture
**Impact**: LOW - Must work with existing `window.appData` system
**Affected Features**:
- "Not interested" functionality must integrate with existing data store
- Pro features must respect existing Pro gating system
- Settings persistence must work with existing language manager

**Mitigation**:
- Use existing `window.appData` structure
- Follow existing localStorage patterns
- Integrate with existing event system

### FTX-6: Marquee Quotes
**Blockers**: None
**Dependencies**:
- Must work with existing translation system
- Must respect existing layout constraints
- Must integrate with existing quote system

### FTX-7: Settings Tie-ins
**Blockers**: 
- Spanish persistence across reload needs verification
- FABs visibility needs testing
- Episode tracking toggle needs modal integration
**Dependencies**:
- Must work with existing language manager
- Must integrate with existing FAB system
- Must respect existing settings persistence

### FTX-8: Community Player Placeholder
**Blockers**: 
- Community player flag not defined
- Load guard not implemented
**Dependencies**:
- Must work with existing feature flag system
- Must integrate with existing community layout
- Must respect existing error handling patterns

## Technical Constraints

### 1. No Global Layout Changes
- Cannot modify existing CSS grid/flexbox layouts
- Cannot change existing positioning systems
- Cannot modify existing responsive breakpoints

### 2. No Sticky Search Modifications
- Cannot change `.top-search` styling
- Cannot modify ancestor overflow/transform/contain
- Cannot interfere with search functionality

### 3. Must Use Existing Systems
- Must use existing data store (`window.appData`)
- Must use existing event system (`AppEvents`)
- Must use existing notification system (`window.Toast`)

### 4. Must Respect Existing Patterns
- Must follow existing code organization
- Must use existing CSS naming conventions
- Must integrate with existing feature flag system

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- FAB positioning conflicts with sticky search
- Quote marquee causing layout shifts
- Pro previews breaking existing responsive design

### Medium Risk
- Data store integration issues
- Event system conflicts
- Notification system overload

### Low Risk
- Individual feature implementation
- CSS styling conflicts
- JavaScript function naming conflicts

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Incremental Implementation
- Implement features one at a time
- Test each feature in isolation
- Verify no conflicts with existing systems

### 2. Staging Environment
- Use `/staging/` directory for all changes
- Test thoroughly before deployment
- Maintain rollback capability

### 3. Feature Flags
- Use existing feature flag system
- Implement features behind flags
- Allow easy enable/disable for testing

### 4. Existing Pattern Compliance
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use existing CSS variables
- Integrate with existing systems

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- All features work without breaking existing functionality
- No conflicts with sticky search system
- No global layout modifications
- All features integrate with existing data store

### Should Have
- All features work on all screen sizes
- All features respect existing responsive design
- All features integrate with existing event system
- All features work with existing Pro gating

### Could Have
- Features enhance existing functionality
- Features improve user experience
- Features are maintainable and extensible
- Features follow existing code quality standards
