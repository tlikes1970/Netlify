# Phase A Analysis Summary - TV Tracker v23.78

## Analysis Complete ✅

Phase A analysis has been completed successfully. All required reports have been generated under `/reports/`:

### Reports Created
1. **`/reports/add-flow-map.md`** - Entry points, call chains, listeners, and reloaders
2. **`/reports/redundancy.md`** - Duplicate listeners, functions, and CSS classes
3. **`/reports/findings.md`** - Root causes, severity levels, and proposed fixes
4. **`/reports/test-plan.md`** - 5-bullet test plan for accessibility verification

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Missing Form Labels** - `#genreFilter` select lacks proper label
2. **Inconsistent ARIA** - Mixed ARIA attribute usage across components
3. **Focus Management** - No focus return after add actions
4. **Skip Links** - Present but need verification
5. **Color Contrast** - Potential issues in CSS variables
6. **Mobile Font Size** - Some text may be <16px on mobile

### Code Quality Issues
- **Mixed Event Patterns** - Both addEventListener and onclick usage
- **Duplicate Functions** - Multiple implementations of similar functionality
- **CSS Redundancy** - Duplicate class definitions and styles
- **Inconsistent Naming** - Multiple event naming conventions

## Next Steps

### Phase B Preparation
1. **Create Snapshot** - Snapshot current project to `/snapshots/YYYYMMDD-HHMM/`
2. **Copy to Staging** - Create `/staging/` copy for all edits
3. **Implement Fixes** - Apply fixes in staging environment only

### Batch Implementation Plan
- **Batch F1** - Guardrails (Skip links, labels, ARIA)
- **Batch B1** - Canonical Add Pipeline (ARIA cleanup, semantic hierarchy)
- **Batch B2** - Render Hygiene (Contrast, font sizes, performance)
- **Batch V1** - Verification (Lighthouse, axe, testing)

## Success Criteria
- **Lighthouse Accessibility ≥95** on both Desktop and Mobile
- **axe: zero Serious/Critical issues** in labels, ARIA, contrast, font sizes
- **Mobile fonts legible** - base ≥16px
- **No Lighthouse red flags** for skip links, labels, ARIA, contrast, or font sizes

## Ready for Phase B

Phase A analysis is complete. The project is ready to proceed to Phase B implementation in the staging environment.

**Current Version**: v23.78
