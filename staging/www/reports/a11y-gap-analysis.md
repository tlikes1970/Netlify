# Accessibility Gap Analysis - TV Tracker v23.79

## Purpose

This document explains potential discrepancies between Cursor's accessibility analysis and Lighthouse/axe results, helping identify why automated tools might report different findings.

## Common Gap Sources

### 1. Environment Mismatch
**Issue**: Cursor analyzes code in isolation vs. Lighthouse tests running application
- **Cursor**: Static code analysis, no runtime behavior
- **Lighthouse**: Tests actual rendered page with JavaScript execution
- **Impact**: Dynamic content, JavaScript-generated elements may not be caught by Cursor

### 2. Component vs. Page-Level Analysis
**Issue**: Cursor focuses on individual components vs. Lighthouse tests entire page
- **Cursor**: Analyzes specific functions, CSS rules, HTML elements
- **Lighthouse**: Tests complete page with all interactions, modals, dynamic content
- **Impact**: Page-level issues (focus management, ARIA relationships) may be missed

### 3. Caching and Service Worker Effects
**Issue**: Staging environment may have different caching behavior
- **Problem**: Service worker may serve cached content
- **Solution**: Clear storage, unregister SW, hard reload before testing
- **Impact**: Old accessibility issues may persist in cached content

### 4. JavaScript Execution Context
**Issue**: Cursor can't test JavaScript-generated accessibility features
- **Problem**: Dynamic ARIA attributes, focus management, error announcements
- **Solution**: Manual testing required for JavaScript-dependent features
- **Impact**: Runtime accessibility features not validated by static analysis

### 5. Mobile-Specific Issues
**Issue**: Cursor analyzes CSS but can't test actual mobile rendering
- **Problem**: Font size calculations, viewport behavior, touch interactions
- **Solution**: Real device testing required
- **Impact**: Mobile accessibility issues may not be caught

## Specific Areas of Concern

### 1. Skip Links Functionality
**Cursor Analysis**: Skip links present in HTML
**Potential Gap**: JavaScript may interfere with skip link behavior
**Testing Required**: Manual keyboard navigation test

### 2. Focus Management
**Cursor Analysis**: Focus return code added to functions
**Potential Gap**: Focus may not work correctly in all scenarios
**Testing Required**: Screen reader and keyboard testing

### 3. ARIA Live Regions
**Cursor Analysis**: Error announcements added to addToList function
**Potential Gap**: Live regions may not work with all screen readers
**Testing Required**: Screen reader testing with actual errors

### 4. Mobile Font Sizes
**Cursor Analysis**: CSS overrides added for mobile
**Potential Gap**: CSS specificity issues, viewport meta tag problems
**Testing Required**: Real mobile device testing

### 5. Form Labels
**Cursor Analysis**: Labels added to form controls
**Potential Gap**: Labels may not be properly associated
**Testing Required**: Screen reader testing with form interactions

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Clear Environment
1. Open staging in incognito mode
2. Clear all storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB)
3. Unregister service worker
4. Hard reload page

### Phase 2: Automated Testing
1. Run Lighthouse Desktop Accessibility
2. Run Lighthouse Mobile Accessibility
3. Run axe-core scan
4. Document all findings

### Phase 3: Manual Testing
1. Keyboard navigation through all functionality
2. Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
3. Mobile device testing
4. Form interaction testing

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis
1. Compare Cursor findings with tool results
2. Identify discrepancies
3. Document root causes
4. Create remediation plan

## Expected Discrepancies

### Likely to Find
- **Focus Management**: May need refinement based on actual usage
- **Mobile Font Sizes**: CSS specificity issues may require adjustment
- **ARIA Live Regions**: May need different implementation approach
- **Skip Links**: May need JavaScript enhancement

### Less Likely to Find
- **Form Labels**: Should work as implemented
- **ARIA Roles**: Should be correct as analyzed
- **Basic HTML Structure**: Should be accessible

## Remediation Plan

### If Lighthouse Scores < 95
1. **Identify specific failures**
2. **Compare with Cursor analysis**
3. **Implement additional fixes**
4. **Re-test until passing**

### If axe Reports Critical Issues
1. **Address each critical issue**
2. **Test with screen readers**
3. **Verify fixes work in practice**
4. **Document lessons learned**

### If Mobile Issues Found
1. **Test on actual devices**
2. **Adjust CSS as needed**
3. **Verify viewport settings**
4. **Test with mobile screen readers**

## Success Metrics

### Target Scores
- **Lighthouse Desktop**: ≥95
- **Lighthouse Mobile**: ≥95
- **axe Critical Issues**: 0
- **axe Serious Issues**: 0

### Manual Testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: 100% functional
- **Screen Reader**: All content accessible
- **Mobile**: All text legible, all controls usable

## Conclusion

This gap analysis helps bridge the difference between static code analysis and runtime accessibility testing. The key is to use both approaches together - Cursor for code-level fixes, and Lighthouse/axe for runtime validation.

The implemented fixes should address the major accessibility issues, but runtime testing will reveal any remaining gaps that need attention.
