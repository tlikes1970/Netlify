```

### Tab System Layout
- **5 Main Tabs:** Home, Currently Watching, Want to Watch, Already Watched, Discover
- **Tab Container:** Horizontal flex layout with badges
- **Content Sections:** Tab-based content switching with `.tab-section` class

### Card Density Analysis
- **Desktop:** 4-6 cards per row (depending on container width)
- **Mobile:** 1 card per row (vertical stack)
- **Horizontal Scrolls:** Variable density based on card width (184px desktop, 64px mobile)

## 3. Problem Areas Identified

### 3.1 CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Issues
**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- **Quote Bar Loading:** `min-height: 60px` prevents shift, but loading state could cause minor shifts
- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Cards populate via JavaScript, potential for layout shifts
- **Image Loading:** Poster images load asynchronously, could cause card height changes

**RECOMMENDED FIXES:**
- Implement skeleton loaders for all dynamic content
- Add `aspect-ratio` CSS property to all poster containers
- Use `contain: layout` for dynamic sections

### 3.2 Overflow & Scroll Issues
**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
- **Horizontal Scrolls:** Multiple horizontal scroll containers (Currently Watching, Next Up)
- **Nested Scrolls:** Community section has potential for nested scrolling
- **Mobile Overflow:** Search controls may overflow on very small screens

**RECOMMENDED FIXES:**
- Add `overscroll-behavior: contain` to all scroll containers
- Implement snap-scroll for horizontal carousels
- Add scroll indicators for better UX

### 3.3 Fixed/Sticky Positioning
**LOW PRIORITY:**
- **Sticky Search:** `.top-search` uses `position: sticky`
- **Tab Container:** Positioned after search, not sticky
- **Header:** Fixed positioning with proper z-index management

**STATUS:** Well implemented with proper z-index layering

## 4. Responsive Design Analysis

### Desktop Layout (≥641px)
- **Grid System:** CSS Grid and Flexbox hybrid
- **Card Layout:** Horizontal cards with poster + content
- **Spacing:** Consistent 16px-32px spacing system
- **Typography:** Hierarchical font sizing with proper line heights

### Mobile Layout (≤768px)
- **Grid System:** Single-column vertical stack
- **Card Layout:** Vertical cards with poster above content
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Spacing:** Reduced spacing (8px-16px) for mobile optimization

### Breakpoint Transitions
- **Smooth Transitions:** CSS transitions for layout changes
- **Content Reflow:** Proper content reordering for mobile
- **Image Scaling:** Responsive image sizing with proper aspect ratios

## 5. CSS Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- **Centralized Variables:** Single source of truth for spacing, colors, and dimensions
- **Consolidated System:** `consolidated-layout.css` provides unified spacing
- **Mobile-First:** Proper mobile-first responsive design
- **Component-Based:** Modular CSS with clear component boundaries

### Areas for Improvement
- **CSS Specificity:** Some `!important` declarations indicate specificity wars
- **File Organization:** Multiple CSS files could be better consolidated
- **Dead Code:** Potential unused CSS rules from multiple iterations

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Layout Performance
- **CSS Containment:** Limited use of `contain` property
- **Will-Change:** Minimal use of `will-change` for animations
- **Transform Usage:** Proper use of transforms for animations

### Recommendations
- Add `contain: layout style paint` to dynamic sections
- Implement `will-change` for animated elements
- Consider CSS custom properties for theme switching

## 7. Accessibility Layout Considerations

### Focus Management
- **Tab Order:** Logical tab order through content
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus states for all interactive elements
- **Skip Links:** No skip links identified

### Screen Reader Support
- **Semantic HTML:** Proper use of semantic elements
- **ARIA Labels:** Comprehensive ARIA labeling
- **Live Regions:** Proper use of `aria-live` for dynamic content

## 8. Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Implement skeleton loaders** for all dynamic content
2. **Add aspect-ratio CSS** to prevent image loading shifts
3. **Consolidate CSS files** to reduce complexity

### Medium Priority
1. **Add scroll indicators** for horizontal carousels
2. **Implement snap-scroll** for better mobile UX
3. **Add skip links** for keyboard navigation

### Low Priority
1. **Audit CSS specificity** and remove unnecessary `!important`
2. **Implement CSS containment** for performance
3. **Add will-change** for animated elements

## 9. Conclusion

The Flicklet TV Tracker has a well-structured responsive layout system with proper breakpoint management and centralized CSS variables. The main areas for improvement focus on preventing layout shifts during content loading and enhancing mobile scroll experiences. The architecture is solid and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between different layout components.

**Overall Assessment:** GOOD with room for optimization
**Mobile Experience:** EXCELLENT
**Desktop Experience:** GOOD
**Performance:** FAIR (needs optimization)
**Accessibility:** GOOD (needs skip links)
