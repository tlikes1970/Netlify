# Rollback Report - Reset to Pre-Combined State

## Files Removed
- `test-home-layout.html` - Test file created during incorrect implementation
- `HOME_LAYOUT_IMPLEMENTATION_v23.38.md` - Summary document created during incorrect implementation

## Files Restored
- `www/index.html` - Restored from `/snapshots/20250112-1400/www/index.html`
- `www/styles/main.css` - Restored from `/snapshots/20250112-1400/www/styles/main.css`

## Summary of Changes Reverted

### What Was Incorrectly Done
1. **Direct modification of main files** - Modified `www/index.html` and `www/styles/main.css` directly instead of working in staging
2. **Skipped Phase A analysis** - Did not properly analyze current Home render path before making changes
3. **Violated process** - Should have created snapshot, then worked in `/staging/` directory only

### What Was Reverted
1. **Home layout changes** - Removed the 6-section immovable contract structure
2. **Quote Bar implementation** - Removed hard-baked Quote Bar between Sticky Search and Group 1
3. **CSS additions** - Removed Quote Bar styling, home groups, and placeholder messages
4. **Runtime guardrails** - Removed order assertion and purge system JavaScript
5. **Version changes** - Reverted title back to original version

### Current State
- **Baseline restored** - Code is back to the state before the incorrect implementation
- **Ready for proper Phase A** - Can now begin correct analysis phase
- **Staging environment ready** - `/staging/` directory exists for proper Phase B work

## Next Steps
1. **Phase A** - Analyze current Home render path and identify legacy selectors
2. **Create proper snapshot** - Before any Phase B changes
3. **Work in staging only** - All edits must happen in `/staging/` directory
4. **Follow process** - Phase A analysis → Phase B implementation in staging

## Verification
- ✅ Main files restored to pre-combined state
- ✅ Test files removed
- ✅ Ready for proper Phase A analysis
- ✅ Staging environment available for Phase B
