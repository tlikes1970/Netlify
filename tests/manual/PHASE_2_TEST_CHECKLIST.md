**Feature Flag:** `flag:touch-event-audit` (logging only)  
**Date:** _______________  
**Tester:** _______________  
**Browser/Device:** _______________

---

## Pre-Test Setup

- [ ] Feature flag is enabled: `localStorage.setItem('flag:touch-event-audit', 'true')`
- [ ] Page refreshed after flag enabled
- [ ] Browser console open for audit warnings
- [ ] Chrome DevTools Performance tab ready
- [ ] Test device/emulator ready

**Verify Setup:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
isFeatureEnabled('touch-event-audit')  // Should return true
window.touchEventAuditor?.enable()  // Enable audit tool
```

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Card Swipe Still Works
**Expected:** Swipes work perfectly, no page scroll interference

**Steps:**
1. Find a swipeable card on the page
2. Swipe horizontally left (drag left)
3. Verify card swipes correctly
4. Swipe horizontally right (drag right)
5. Verify card swipes correctly
6. Verify page does NOT scroll vertically during horizontal swipes

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Horizontal swipes work smoothly
- [ ] Page does NOT scroll during horizontal swipe
- [ ] Card animations are smooth
- [ ] Swipe gestures feel responsive

**Notes:**
```
(Record any issues, scroll interference, jank)
```

---

### Test 2: Vertical Page Scroll
**Expected:** Smooth, native-feeling scroll

**Steps:**
1. Scroll page vertically up
2. Scroll page vertically down
3. Scroll rapidly up and down
4. Observe scroll behavior

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Scroll is smooth (60fps feel)
- [ ] No jank or stuttering
- [ ] Momentum scrolling works (iOS)
- [ ] Scroll reaches top
- [ ] Scroll reaches bottom
- [ ] No console warnings about passive listeners

**Performance Check:**
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- [ ] Record while scrolling
- [ ] Check for scroll performance issues
- [ ] FPS should remain high (50-60fps)

**Notes:**
```
(Record any performance issues, jank, warnings)
```

---

### Test 3: Pull-to-Refresh (if applicable)
**Expected:** Pull-to-refresh works perfectly, page doesn't scroll during pull

**Steps:**
1. Scroll page to very top (scrollTop = 0)
2. Pull down from top of page
3. Observe refresh indicator (if any)
4. Release
5. Verify refresh triggers (if applicable)
6. Verify page doesn't scroll during pull

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Not Available

**Observations:**
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh exists and works
- [ ] Page does NOT scroll during pull
- [ ] Refresh triggers at correct threshold
- [ ] Smooth release animation
- [ ] No console errors

**Notes:**
```
(Record pull-to-refresh behavior, any issues)
```

---

### Test 4: Modal Touch Interactions
**Expected:** Modal scrolling isolated, smooth

**Steps:**
1. Open Episode Tracking modal (or Settings modal with scrollable content)
2. Touch and drag to scroll modal content vertically
3. Verify modal content scrolls smoothly
4. Verify background page does NOT scroll (stay locked)
5. Try fast scrolling in modal
6. Close modal

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Modal content scrolls smoothly
- [ ] Background stays completely locked
- [ ] No scroll leaking to background
- [ ] Modal scroll feels responsive
- [ ] No console errors

**Notes:**
```
(Record modal scroll behavior, any isolation issues)
```

---

### Test 5: Mixed Touch Gestures
**Expected:** No gesture conflicts, smooth handling

**Steps:**
1. Start vertical scroll on page
2. While scrolling, try to swipe a card horizontally
3. Try rapid touch interactions (tap, scroll, swipe)
4. Test touch interactions near card edges
5. Try diagonal gestures

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Vertical scroll and horizontal swipe don't conflict
- [ ] Gesture detection is quick and accurate
- [ ] No unexpected gesture triggers
- [ ] Smooth transition between gestures
- [ ] Rapid interactions handled correctly

**Notes:**
```
(Record any gesture conflicts, false triggers, issues)
```

---

## Console Audit Checks

### Passive Listener Warnings
- [ ] Open Chrome DevTools Console
- [ ] Look for warnings: "Added non-passive event listener to a scroll-blocking event"
- [ ] Count warnings (should be minimal or zero after fixes)
- [ ] Note which components trigger warnings

**Warning Count:** _____  
**Warning Sources:**
1. 
2. 
3. 

**Notes:**
```
(Record all passive listener warnings found)
```

---

### Audit Tool Verification
```javascript
// Check audit tool
window.touchEventAuditor?.enable()
// Interact with page (swipe, scroll, touch)
window.touchEventAuditor?.getReport()
```

**Audit Results:**
- [ ] Audit tool works
- [ ] Report generated
- [ ] Listeners documented

**Report Summary:**
```
(Summarize audit report findings)
```

**What Didn't Change:**
- Existing touch behaviors (should be identical)
- Swipe gestures (should work the same)
- Scroll performance (should be same or better)
