# Phase 4 Test Checklist - Modal Scroll Isolation Improvements

**Phase:** 4 - Modal Scroll Isolation Improvements  
**Feature Flag:** `flag:modal-scroll-isolation`  
**Date:** _______________  
**Tester:** _______________  
**Browser/Device:** _______________

---

## Pre-Test Setup

- [ ] Feature flag is enabled: `localStorage.setItem('flag:modal-scroll-isolation', 'true')`
- [ ] Phase 1 flag also enabled: `localStorage.setItem('flag:scroll-lock-safety', 'true')` (recommended)
- [ ] Page refreshed after flags enabled
- [ ] Browser console open for debugging
- [ ] Device ready for testing

**Verify Setup:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
isFeatureEnabled('modal-scroll-isolation')  // Should return true
window.modalScrollIsolation?.isModalIsolationEnabled()  // Should return true
```

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Modal Scroll Boundaries

**Expected:** Modal scroll boundaries respected, no background scroll during overscroll attempts

**Steps:**
1. Open Episode Tracking modal (or any modal with scrollable content)
2. Scroll modal content to the very top
3. Try to scroll past the top (drag/scroll upward beyond limit)
4. Verify NO background page scroll happens at all
5. Scroll modal content to the very bottom
6. Try to scroll past the bottom (drag/scroll downward beyond limit)
7. Verify NO background page scroll happens at all

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Top boundary prevents background scroll
- [ ] Bottom boundary prevents background scroll
- [ ] Modal scroll still works normally (within boundaries)
- [ ] No visual glitches or jumps

**Notes:**
```
(Record any overscroll leakage, boundary issues)
```

---

### Test 2: Fast Scroll in Modal

**Expected:** Background absolutely locked during rapid modal scrolling

**Steps:**
1. Open Episode Tracking modal (or modal with lots of scrollable content)
2. Rapidly scroll up and down in the modal content (fast flick scrolling)
3. While rapidly scrolling, observe the background page
4. Verify background page stays COMPLETELY still (zero movement)
5. Continue rapid scrolling for 10-15 seconds
6. Verify background never moves, even slightly

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Background completely locked during fast scroll
- [ ] No visual movement of background at all
- [ ] Modal scroll remains smooth
- [ ] No performance issues

**Notes:**
```
(Record any background scroll leakage during fast scrolling)
```

---

### Test 3: Modal Touch Edge Cases

**Expected:** Edge touches don't affect background, smooth transitions

**Steps:**
1. Open any modal
2. Touch near the edge of the modal (where background overlay is visible)
3. Drag your finger toward the background area (outside modal)
4. Verify background does NOT scroll at all
5. Drag your finger back into the modal area
6. Continue scrolling the modal content
7. Verify modal scrolling still works normally

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Touching near edges doesn't scroll background
- [ ] Dragging to background area doesn't scroll background
- [ ] Modal scroll works when dragging back into modal
- [ ] Smooth transition between edge and modal area

**Notes:**
```
(Record edge case behavior, any background scroll from edge touches)
```

---

### Test 4: Nested Scrollable Areas

**Expected:** Nested scrolling works independently, background locked

**Steps:**
1. Open modal with nested scrollable content (if available)
   - If none exist, scroll a modal that has scrollable sections within scrollable modal
2. Scroll the inner scrollable area
3. Verify inner area scrolls independently
4. Scroll the outer modal area
5. Verify outer area scrolls independently
6. Verify background never scrolls during any of this
7. Test scrolling both simultaneously if possible

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Inner scrollable area works independently
- [ ] Outer modal area works independently
- [ ] Background never scrolls
- [ ] No scroll conflicts between nested areas

**Notes:**
```
(Record nested scrolling behavior, any conflicts or background scroll)
```

---

### Test 5: Modal with Keyboard

**Expected:** Keyboard handling doesn't break scroll lock

**Steps:**
1. Open Settings modal (or any modal with text input)
2. Scroll modal to bottom
3. Tap a text input field at the bottom
4. Keyboard slides up
5. Input moves into view (normal behavior - this is OK)
6. While keyboard is open, try to scroll the background page
7. Verify background is STILL locked (doesn't scroll)
8. Try scrolling modal content (if still possible)
9. Close keyboard
10. Close modal
11. Verify scroll position is correct

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Observations:**
- [ ] Background stays locked during keyboard
- [ ] Modal scrolling still works with keyboard (if applicable)
- [ ] Position preserved after keyboard dismiss
- [ ] Position correct after modal close
- [ ] No visual glitches during keyboard animations

**Notes:**
```
(Record keyboard behavior, any lock failures, position issues)
```

---

### Test 6: Modal Scroll Performance

**Expected:** Smooth scrolling, no performance regression

**Steps:**
1. Open Episode Tracking modal (has lots of content)
2. Rapidly scroll through all the content
3. Scroll up and down repeatedly
4. Verify smooth 60fps scrolling (check visually - should be smooth)
5. Verify no jank or stuttering
6. Verify background still locked throughout (check after scrolling)
7. Open and close modal multiple times while scrolling rapidly

**Result:** ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Partial

**Performance Check:**
- [ ] Smooth scrolling (60fps feel)
- [ ] No jank or stuttering
- [ ] No performance regression vs. before
- [ ] Background locked throughout
- [ ] No memory leaks (check with dev tools if possible)

**Notes:**
```
(Record performance issues, jank, stuttering, any regressions)
```

## Regression Tests

### Other Modals Still Work
- [ ] Test Settings modal (if different implementation)
- [ ] Test FlickWord modal
- [ ] Test Trivia modal
- [ ] Test Auth modal
- [ ] Test Help modal
- [ ] Verify all modals still open/close correctly
- [ ] Verify all modals have scroll isolation when enabled

**Notes:**
```
(Any issues with other modals?)
```

## Console Checks

### Debugging
- [ ] Check console for any errors related to modal scroll isolation
- [ ] Verify no warnings about preventDefault on passive listeners
- [ ] Check that isolation utilities are accessible:
  ```javascript
  window.modalScrollIsolation?.isModalIsolationEnabled()  // Should return true
  ```

### Errors
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Errors found:
  ```

## Debugging Tips

If tests fail:

1. **Enable verbose logging:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('flag:scroll-logging', 'true');
   localStorage.setItem('flag:modal-scroll-isolation', 'true');
   localStorage.setItem('flag:scroll-lock-safety', 'true');
   // Refresh page
   ```

2. **Check modal isolation state:**
   ```javascript
   // Check if isolation is enabled
   window.modalScrollIsolation?.isModalIsolationEnabled()
   
   // Manually apply isolation to a modal (for testing)
   const modal = document.querySelector('[class*="modal"]');
   const overlay = document.querySelector('[class*="overlay"], [class*="backdrop"]');
   window.modalScrollIsolation?.applyModalScrollIsolation(modal, overlay);
   ```

3. **Verify overscroll-behavior CSS:**
   ```javascript
   // Check if CSS is applied
   const modalContent = document.querySelector('[class*="content"]');
   getComputedStyle(modalContent).overscrollBehavior  // Should be 'contain'
   ```

4. **Monitor scroll events:**
   ```javascript
   // Check if background scrolls during modal
   let backgroundScrollY = window.scrollY;
   // Open modal, scroll modal
   console.log('Background scroll change:', window.scrollY - backgroundScrollY);  // Should be 0
   ```

## Notes

**Modal Components Updated:**
- EpisodeTrackingModal (example implementation)
- Other modals can be updated similarly using `useModalScrollIsolation` hook

**Integration with Other Phases:**
- Phase 1 (scroll lock safety) should be enabled for best results
- Phase 3 (iOS fixes) may interact with modal isolation - test on iOS
- Phase 4 isolation works independently but benefits from Phase 1 safety improvements
